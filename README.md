The xPico360 is a project that allows a Pico with headers to be soldered directly to the PCB, or connected via female GPIO headers, and will breakout the connections for SPI, MMC/eMMC, Sonus, and glitch chip flashing to JST style connectors similar to what the xFlasher360 and JRP use.

This project was practice for making my first PCB and is not intended to be a reliable replacement for current flashers. After the cost of a Pico, PCB fabrication, and BOM the money would be better spents towards a trusted flasher like the xFlasher360. You can find sources to purchase one here: https://themodshop.co/shop/xflasher

Would make a fun afternoon project for having a spare flasher around.
